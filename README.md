# pygtfcode

**pygtfcode** is a modern Python implementation of a 1D Lagrangian gravothermal fluid code. It simulates the dynamical evolution of self-interacting dark matter halos using the fluid approximation, based on a Fortran code originally developed by Prof. Frank van den Bosch (Yale University).

This implementation follows the formalism outlined in Nishikawa et al. (2020), with modular components for initialization, evolution, and output.

See the `./examples/demo.ipynb` for more comprehensive guidance on using this module.

## Overview

The code is organized around **two user-facing classes**:

### 1. `Config`

Stores static input parameters, grouped into modules:

* `io`: Output paths and snapshot cadence
* `grid`: Grid resolution and domain
* `init`: Initial profile (NFW, truncated NFW, or $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$)
* `sim`: Physical parameters and simulation option (e.g., self-interaction cross section, calibrated parameters)
* `prec`: Precision tolerances and iteration limits

### 2. `State`

Holds the dynamically evolving quantities:

* Radial grid and shell midpoints: `r`, `rmid`
* Physical variables: `m`, `rho`, `p`, `u`, `v2`, `kn`, `trelax`
* Diagnostic quantities: `mintrel`, `maxvel`, `minkn`, `du_max`, `dr_max`
* Time tracking: `t`, `dt`, `step_count`, `snapshot_index`
* Characteristic scales (derived from `Config`)
* A `run()` method to evolve the system until collapse or a stopping condition is reached

A `State` object can be constructed in one of two ways:
1. From a `Config` object.  The `Config` object then becomes an attribute of `State`.  In this way, multiple `State`s can be instantiated with different `Config` objects.
2. From the directory of a simulation that has already been initialized.  This is useful for either analyzing or resuming a simulation from a different Python session.  No `Config` object is needed.  By default the state will initialize to the latest snapshot of the imported simulation.

Note that `r` and `m` define bin edges, while `rho`, `p`, `u`, `v2`, `kn`, and `trelax` are all defined at `rmid`.  Therefore, `r` and `m` are longer than the other arrays by one entry.

In addition to these two classes, there are three plotting functions that are automatically imported, each of which also exists as a method of `State`:

### 1. `plot_time_evolution()`

Plot the time evolution of any one of a number of system-wide quantities.  Multiple simulations can be passed to compare their evolutions on the same plot.

### 2. `plot_snapshots()`

Plot up to three profiles of a simulation or multiple simulations at specified points in time.

### 3. `make_movie()`

Animate the full evolution of up to three profiles.  This required ffmpeg to be installed and callable with `ffmpeg` from the working directory.

Use `help()` for documentation on any of these classes, methods, and functions.

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaronetokayer/pygtfcode.git
cd pygtfcode
pip install -e .
```

Dependencies: Python 3.8+, `numpy`, `scipy`, `numba`, `matplotlib`, `tqdm`

### Example usage

```python
import pygtfcode as gtf

config = gtf.Config()
state = gtf.State.from_config(config)
state.run()
```

To import an existing simulation:

```python
import pygtfcode as gtf

state = gtf.State.from_dir(model_dir='/path/to/Model002')

# The latest snapshot will be loaded by default.  To load a particular snapshot:
state = gtf.State.from_dir(model_dir='/path/to/Model002', snapshot=59)
```

Alternatively, you can call `from pygtfcode import Config, State`.  In that case, plotting functions will not be automatically imported.

We can also run for a specified duration:
```python
state.run(steps=100) # Run for 100 simulation steps
state.run(time=55.0) # Run for a duration of 55.0 simulation time units
state.run(rho_c=500.0) # Run until the central density exceeds 500.0
```

Halting criteria in `config` override these conditions.  multiple `run()` commands can be executed in succession, and each will continue from the current state.  Call `state.reset()` to reset the state to its initial condition and reset the set counter.

To customize defaults:

```python
# Customize initial profile
config.init = "abg"                                 # Use ABG with default params
config.init = ("abg", {"alpha": 3.5, "beta": 4.5})  # Custom ABG

# Customize other configuration parameters
config.grid.ngrid = 200
config.io.model_no = 42
config.io.base_dir = "/tmp/sims"                    # Default is the current working directory
config.sim.sigma_m = 1.0

# Switch to a truncated NFW
config.init = ("truncated_nfw", {"Zt": 0.05, "deltaP": 1e-4})

# Turn off chatter
config.io.chatter = False
```

If you don’t explicitly assign `config.io.model_no`, it is automatically set to the next available model number in `config.io.base_dir` (e.g., if `Model000`, `Model001`, and `Model002` directories exist, it will assign `model_no = 3`) **when a `State` is instantiated**. You can explicity assign a `model_no` with `config = gtf.Config(model_no=5)` or with `config.io.model_no = 5` once config is instantiated.  Note that in that case, outputs from a previous simulations with the same `model_no` will be overridden.

### Plotting

There are three plotting functions that are imported with the `pygtfcode` package:

The `plot_time_evolution()` function plots the evolution of system-wide parameters over time.  It can plot any of the columns in the `time_evolution.txt` output.

```python
import pygtfcode as gtf

# Compare the central density evolution of two different simulations
# The default plot is `rho_c` when no quantity is specified
gtf.plot_time_evolution(state1, state2)

# Alternatively, the simulations can be called by their Config objects or by their model numbers
# v_max_phys returns the max velocity in physical units (km/s)
gtf.plot_time_evolution(config1, config2, quantity="v_max_phys", ylabel=r"Custom ylabel")

# base_dir needs to be specified if simulations are called by model number:
gtf.plot_time_evolution(5, 6, quantity="kn_min", base_dir='./') # This is useful for simulations run in a different session

# The plot can be saved to a file
# Use 'show' to show the figure in standard output as well
gtf.plot_time_evolution(state1, filepath='./rho_c_vs_time.png', show=True)
```

The `plot_snapshots()` function plots up to three profiles in separate panels for one or multiple snapshots of the simulation.  Snapshots are specified by the index of the `snapshot_x.dat` file.  Like `plot_time_evolution()`, the State object, Config object, or model number can used to specify the simulation you wish to plot.

```python
import pygtfcode as gtf

# Plot the initial density profile
gtf.plot_snapshots(state)

# Plot the mass profile at a specified snapshot
gtf.plot_snapshots(config, snapshots=50, profiles='m')

# Plot the density, v^2, and Knudsen number profiles, comparing several snapshots
gtf.plot_snapshots(4, snapshots=[0, 50, 100], profiles=['rho', 'v2', 'kn'], base_dir='./')

# The plot can be saved to a file
# Use 'show=True' to show the figure in standard output as well
gtf.plot_snapshots(state, filepath='./initial_rho.png')
```

The `make_movie()` function generates animations of up to three profiles in separate panels for a simulation.  Like `plot_time_evolution()`, the State object, Config object, or model number can used to specify the simulation you wish to plot.  Only the snapshots of the most recent run for the simulation model_no will be included, even if profiles with higher indices are in the directory from previous simulation runs.  You can check the current version of the `snapshot_conversion.txt` file for all snapshots that will be included in the animation

```python
import pygtfcode as gtf

# Plot the density profile
gtf.make_movie(state)

# All keyword arguments available in plot_snapshots function, other than 'snapshots', can be used here
gtf.make_movie(2, base_dir='./', profiles=['v2', 'p'], grid=True)
```

The plotting functions also exist as methods to the `State` object:

```python
import pygtfcode as gtf

config = gtf.Config()
state = gtf.State.from_config(config)
state.run()

state.plot_time_evolution()         # Accepts all keyword arguments, but cannot compare between simulations when used this way

state.plot_snapshots()              # Defaults to the latest state
state.plot_snapshots(snapshots=0, filename="./initial_profs.png")   # Plot and save initial profiles
# Note that while the standalone function defaults to the initial profile, the `State` method defaults to the current state.

state.make_movie(profiles=['rho', 'kn', 'v2'])
```

---

## Output files

All outputs are written to the directory specified by `config.io.base_dir` and `model_no`.

### 1. `model_metadata.txt`

Stores all information about the simulation model for reference.  Unpacks all attributes of the `Config` object that instantiated the `State`.

### 2. `logfile.txt`

Logs relevant quantities every `nlog` steps (set in `config.io`).  If `chatter` is set to `True`, then these are also output to the console.

### 3. `profile_x.dat`

Radial profiles of all fluid variables, written each time the central density changes by a fractional amount `drho_prof` (set in `config.io`). The suffix `x` is the snapshot index.  `snapshot_conversion.txt` stores the conversion between the snapshot index `x` and simulation time.

Each row contains:

```
i   log(r_i)   log(rmid_i)   m_i   rho_i   v2_i   trelax_i   kn_i
```

### 4. `time_evolution.txt`

Records the time evolution of relevant quantites, written each time the central density changes by a fractional amount `drho_tevol` (set in `config.io`).
